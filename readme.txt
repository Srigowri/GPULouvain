INPUT:  Undirected Graph (Refer: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html)

OUTPUT: Number of communities/partitions, overall modularity, and visualizing the communities

(Task: Optimization modularity to get the best partitions)
To keep in mind:

Dataset that come in different formats: txt, .net, .paj, .gml

Edge list (canâ€™t represent isolated vertices unless it has self loop)

Many datasets on SNAP have different fields of data

Different data types
